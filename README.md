# Feelings-404 üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Alone aaahh


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Vishvesh - Sree buddha 

### Project Description
Feelings404 is an AI therapist with no filter, no pity, and zero emotional support. It roasts you, mocks your excuses, and breaks your ego‚Äîjust to build you back stronger. Harsh? Yes. Helpful? Surprisingly. If you want comfort, look elsewhere. If you want change, let the emotional damage begin.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most mental health and motivational apps offer comfort, empathy, and gentle encouragement. But for many people ‚Äî especially those who:

shut down at "soft talk"

ignore coddling advice

respond better to harsh truth

find dark humor therapeutic

need a wake-up call, not a lullaby

‚Ä¶this approach doesn‚Äôt work

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A no-mercy, emotionally unavailable AI that mocks, roasts, and bullies you into fixing your life.
